Outlandish Docker image for WordPress with dev tools

## CI builds

We use GitHub Actions to build and push to Docker Hub daily and on changes on
the `master` branch.

See [the docs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images?version=v2.7.0)
for more on how and why CI and Dependabot are configured within `.github`.
